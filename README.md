"Assignment Objective: To develop a program to evaluate the set of FIRST for a given grammar

Instructions:
Part 1 will be to develop the entire program framework in C++ to calculate FIRST(α) for each terminal and non-
terminal for the given grammar. It will read a grammar from a specified file and, using an appropriate set of
classes/data structures, will store the Productions of the Grammar and identify the Terminals and the non-
terminals, as well as the start symbol. For the purposes of this assignment, ε (epsilon) will be represented by
the character ‘&’. This program will print the grammar that it has processed to demonstrate that the grammar
has been stored correctly, with its components appropriately identified.

Part 2 will be to develop the algorithms to calculate and print FIRST(α) for each terminal and non-terminal for
the given grammar.

The grammar will be of the following syntax/format:
S -> aBa | bCb ;
B -> a | b ;
C -> def | fed ;
C -> dog ;

The program shall be written in C++. Appropriate uses of .cpp, .h, and makefile files is expected."
